Moviezilla is a Movie Recommendation System built using Machine Learning to recommend Movies to the user based on their favorite movies or actors.

Recommendation Basis:
In the Recommendation feature, the recommendations can be done on the basis of Movie name and  User’s favourite Actors. The Recommendation Model works on the basis of Cosine Similarity.

Wishlist Movies: 
We provide the user with a facility to wishlist the movies they want to save on their User profile page and these movies are recorded in the wishlist Database.

Trending Movies:
In this feature, with the help of EDA done on the dataset, we determine top 3 movies according to the popularity attribute and display those in the Treding movies section on the Dashboard.

User’s Favourites Section:
In this feature,  we ask the user to select their favorite genres during Signup and we use the stored data to display movies from the User’s favourite genres on their Dashboard.
